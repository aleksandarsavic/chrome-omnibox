### Chrome OmniBox extension for OpenPhoto

This is a Chromium/Google Chrome extension that lets you quickly search your OpenPhoto tags. Using the keyword `op` you can immediately filter through your tags and then select the one to view. That'll take you to your site displaying photos with that tag.
